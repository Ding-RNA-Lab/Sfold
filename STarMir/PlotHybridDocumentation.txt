Notes regarding the plot_hybrid scripts

the plot_Hybrid scripts are scripts that were use by our lab to create high quality diagrams of
the hybridization of mRNAs and miRNAs.  They are rough "researcher" scripts, but they have served
us well for papers and posters.

Using the scripts

The arguments, the two scripts  plot_Hybrid_PDF.R and plot_Hybrid_PDF2.R vary only in the first
argument.  The scripts were designed to be used in a batch environment as part of a pipeline.
The change is to optimize the scripts for a particular pipeline.

The 'Web' scripts were used on our web tool for Starmir.  I include them here as a curiosity.

usage plot_Hybrid_PDF.R <Site ID> <Target Name> <miRNA Name> <site position> <Tar MisMat> <Tar Mat> <miRNA Mat> <miRNA MisMat> <dG Hybrid>

The arguments are positional.  All must be present to run the script.


Site ID -- an integer.  Used to build the output file name. (plot_Hybrid_PDF)
Output Filename -- a string.  Used to build the output file name (plot_Hybrid_PDF2)

Target Name   -- string name identifying the target mRNA or fragment
miRNA         -- string name identifying the target mircroRNA
site position -- integer position of the binding site relative to the mRNA or fragment
Tar MisMat    -- string identifies the nucleitides on the target sequence that are not bound
                 to the miRNA
Tar Mat       -- string identifies the nucleitides on the target sequence that are bound
                 to the miRNA
miRNA Mat     -- string identifies the nucleitides on the miRNA that are bound
                 to the target mRNA
miRNA MisMat  -- string identifies the nucleitides on the miRNA that are not bound
                 to the target mRNA

The last four arguments appear in the Starmir output files in that order.  They also appear
in RNAhybrid output files if you display the output in the compact form.

dG Hybrid     -- float Delta G hybridization energy.  Used in diagram labels.


These scripts were used in the batch processing of starmir output.  The intent is that the
driver script takes a file of output, parses out the necessary fields and builds a call to
the R scripts.  It will create a pdf file containing the diagram for each line in the file.

The web scripts were set up to use the modified Starmir output used by our website to build output
pages.  The pdf diagrams on the web page are created using the plotHybridWeb.R script.

No special R packages are required to run the scripts, but, of course, R must be available on the machine.
